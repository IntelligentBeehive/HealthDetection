# The IntelligentBeehive Project

## Introduction
The goal of the Intelligent Beehive Project is to research, invent and implement possible ways to gather and analyse Data from a BeeHive using state of the art technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision. This is done by splitting the project into 5 separte Components. For each Component one researched is responsible.

## Possible outcomes for this project are:
* Using the Data to create a map of the biodiversity of a certain area so that for example city councils can plant more plants in a certain area. 
* Using the Data to make a automated hive monitoring system which can notify the bee keeper if the health of the hive is going down. 

## Components
* Waggle Dance Detection
* Hive Health Detection
* Bee Sound Detection
* Pollen Color Detection
* Hive Sensors
