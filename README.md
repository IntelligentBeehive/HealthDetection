# The IntelligentBeehive Project

## Introduction
The goal of the Intelligent Beehive Project is to research, invent and implement possible ways to gather and analyse Data from a BeeHive using state of the art technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.
The project is split into several different components



## Possible outcomes for this project are:
* Using the Data to create a map of the biodiversity of a certain area so that for example city councils can plant more plants in a certain area. 
* Using the Data to make a automated hive monitoring system which can notify the bee owner when the hive might be in danger.

## Components
* Waggle Dance Detection
* Hive Health Detection
* Bee Sound Detection
* Pollen Color Detection
* Hive Sensors

## Institute's
Fontys 
## Our team
Our team that is currently working on this project are:
* Luuk Ebenau (waggledance detection)
* Sieuwe Elferink (bee health detection)
* Dirk Heijen (bee audio analysis)
* Dion Trilbeek (Sensor data)
* Hugo  (Pollen Analysis)

## Used Hardware
For this project we've used a large amount of hardware components (besides the beehive)
These are the hardware components that we use:
